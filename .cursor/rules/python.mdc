# Python Rules

- Follow PEP 8 style guides and naming conventions.

- Use type hinting to enhance code readability and type safety.

- Manage dependencies using virtual environments:

- Use requirements.txt to track dependencies.

- Use context managers to handle resources (e.g., file operations).

- Prioritize the use of list comprehensions, generator expressions, and dictionary comprehensions.

- Use pytest for testing and maintain high test coverage.

- Use docstrings to document functions, classes, and modules.

- Adhere to Object-Oriented Design principles (SOLID).

- Use exception handling to ensure program robustness.

- Use dataclasses or pydantic models for data representation.

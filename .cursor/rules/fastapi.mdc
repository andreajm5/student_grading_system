# FastAPI Rules

- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values.

- Use Pydantic models for request and response validation.

- Use appropriate HTTP methods in path operation decorators (@app.get, @app.post, etc.).

- Use Dependency Injection for shared logic, such as database connections and authentication.

- Use background tasks for non-blocking operations.

- Use appropriate status codes for responses (201 for Created, 404 for Not Found, etc.).

- Use APIRouter to organize routes by feature or resource.

- Use path parameters, query parameters, and request bodies appropriately.
